## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current version | **0.4.0** (HTTP/1.1 + HTTPS; GET / POST / arbitrary methods; custom headers — over the taar transport) |
| Status | Working. `whirl [-X M] [-d DATA] [-H 'H: v'] [-o FILE] [-L] http(s)://…` — resolve + connect (+ TLS) + request + emit body; redirects (`-L`, incl. http→https, followed as GET); cert chain + hostname verified fail-closed. |
| Module footprint | `src/{url,http,cli,transport,output,main}.cyr` (+ `test.cyr`). url/http pure-tested; transport rides taar (TCP+DNS) + stdlib tls for https. |
| Cyrius pin | 6.2.6 (family-aligned with yo / dig / taar) |
| Backends | Linux (raw-syscall TCP via taar; tls_native's default raw read/write on the fd for TLS). AGNOS socket backend (taar `#ifdef` + tls_native `set_transport`) is the follow-up. **No `lib/net.cyr`** — sovereign. |
| Tests | `tests/whirl.tcyr` → **31 assertions** (URL parse + HTTP framing); live: `http://neverssl.com` + `https://example.com` fetch, `expired.badssl.com` rejected. |
| Family position | Third entry in the network-tools family (after yo + dig). Third `taar` consumer — drove taar's `socket` + `dns` modules (taar 0.2.0); `tcp`/`tls`/`http` growth continues. |
| Deps | stdlib base + **`[deps.taar]` 0.2.0** (socket + dns) + the **opt-in crypto/TLS libs** (`chrono`/`ct`/`keccak`/`random`/`bayan`/`sigil`/`tls_native`/`tls`, vendored via `cyrius lib sync` — wired into CI). No stdlib `net`/`sandhi`. |

## AGNOS readiness

whirl needs **zero new kernel syscalls** — the full call surface (`sock_*`#47-50, `getrandom`#45, UDP-53 #51-54, `uptime_ms`#40/`sleep_ms`#41) is already landed, and the client band + `tls_native` are wired in the cyrius peer (6.2.3+). The HTTPS-on-agnos path is composing `tls_native` over the socket transport — confirmed when the transport src lands. Full table in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) § *AGNOS call surface*.

## Carry-forward (dependent on other repos)

| Item | Blocked on | Owning repo |
|---|---|---|
| `taar` `tcp`/`tls`/`http` modules | whirl is the third consumer that adds them | whirl + taar |
| HTTPS client on agnos | `tls_native` over the socket transport (cyrius peer) | cyrius (language agent) |
| taar dep resolves in CI | taar `0.1.x` tag pushed to GitHub | taar (release) |
